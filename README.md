# pygame stuff

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
--OR--
python -m pip install pygame
```

`main_old.py` has a bunch of commented out code while `main.py` is final, cleaned up version.

Main differences:
* Delta Time
* Modularized the classes and functions

did this just to learn something new :)

### Couldn't be bothered to add these things:
* Sounds
* Text on menu screen
