# pygame stuff

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
--OR--
python -m pip install pygame
```

`main_old.py` has a bunch of commented out code while `main.py` is final, cleaned up version.

The main difference is that I implemented delta time here. This is so that you do not have to force the game to run at 60 FPS max

did this just to learn something new :)

### Couldn't be bothered to add these things:
* Sounds
* Text on menu screen
